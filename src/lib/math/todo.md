[ ] Multiple graphs in one plot (@Badosz)
[ ] Export button to render input term in the top left (?) corner of the graph. White background, black axis, one color for each graph (@Badosz)
[x] Normalize 3d flat graph colors and add a legend to tell which color means which value
[x] Proper 2.5d plot of a 3d function
[ ] Make variable t special: animates over time producing a gif output instead of a png (@Cubey)
